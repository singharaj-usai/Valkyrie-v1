                This platform stores your username(s), e-mail address(es), IP

                  information is required to login and find other users on both
                  our website and game and is displayed on user profiles like
                  this one.

                  verify your e-mail address immediately after you create your
                  account so we can verify you are a legitimate human being
                  trying to use our website. Your e-mail address can also be
                  used to retrieve your account when you forget your password

                  we provide.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>IP addresses</b> - IP addresses are stored for security and
                  moderation purposes. Using your IP address, we are able to
                  detect if you are really you using your own account and to
                  find any violations of our terms of services within our
                  platform. We reserve the right to block your IP address from

                  Your passwords are stored securely within our database server
                  in such way that nobody including us, can retrieve your

                <li>
                  <b>"Bux" virtual currency</b> - "Bux" is our virtual currency
                  used to and sell buy items for users' characters. This is
                  increased over time (or when users sell items) and decreases
                  when users buy virtual items. This value can only be seen by

                <li>
                  <b>The amount of forum posts users have made</b> - This is a
                  number that indicates how many forum posts users have posted
                  which increases when users post new messages on the forums and
                  may decrease when moderators remove their messages whenever
                  needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Join dates</b> - When accounts are created, a timestamp is
                  recorded immediately during the creation of these accounts.
                  These dates indicate when someone has joined our website and
                  can be seen by everyone on either forum messages or their

                  their password, email address or other security related
                  features. The amount of dates that relate to this is not a

                <li>

                  easily make sure if someone else is on their account or if
                  they left a session running. More often than not, this makes
